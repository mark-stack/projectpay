## ProjectPay
### Job application by Mark Evans
### This is an example project to demonstrate abilities with your current and future stack:

This project is deployed with Laravel Forge. I've opted to use current versions of everything:
- Laravel 10
- Vue.js (v3) - composition API
- Server: Nginx
- CSS: Tailwind
- Payment gateway: Stripe
- MySQL, Redis
- Testing: PHPUnit
- Cloud: Amazon S3
- Deployment: Forge

### What does it do?
A live demo to demonstrate capability with the required stack (Laravel + Vue). It's visually basic, but has core functionality like: 
- SPA behavior (Single Page Application)
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Payment gateway
- Relationships
- Authentification
- APIs.

### How to try it?
- It's hosted on a Forge IP address at [44.213.247.67](http://44.213.247.67)
- Click on 'register'. Enter some fake details. The email verification step is skipped for expediency.
- Click around the SPA. You can create a new project and submit the funds with Stripe.
